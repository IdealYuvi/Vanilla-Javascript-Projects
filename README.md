# Vanilla-JavaScript-Projects
This repo contains the projects I did when I started learning JavaScript. There are some interesting projects such as Breakout Game, Pig Game, Guess My Number and Github Finder. JS code heavy project, Bankist App is something to take a look at. The Bankist Website that goes with the previous Bankist App is also beautiful and dynamic.
